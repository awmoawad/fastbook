### The Drivetrain Approach

There are many accurate models that are of no use to anyone, and many inaccurate models that are highly useful. To ensure that your modeling work is useful in practice, you need to consider how your work will be used. In 2012 Jeremy, along with Margit Zwemer and Mike Loukides, introduced a method called ***the Drivetrain Approach*** for thinking about this issue.

The Drivetrain Approach, illustrated in <<drivetrain>>, was described in detail in ["Designing Great Data Products"](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/drivetrain-approach-data-products/). The basic idea is to start with considering your objective, then think about what actions you can take to meet that objective and what data you have (or can acquire) that can help, and then build a model that you can use to determine the best actions to take to get the best results in terms of your objective.
